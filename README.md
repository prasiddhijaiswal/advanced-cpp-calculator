# Advanced C++ Calculator

This is an advanced calculator app built in C++ that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, power, and square root operations.

## âœ… Features
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%) â€” Integer modulus
- Power (^) â€” Exponentiation using `pow()`
- Square Root (s) â€” Calculates square root of a number
- Loop to continue calculations until the user quits
- Handles division by zero and invalid input errors

## âœ… How to Use
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (like g++, Code::Blocks, or an online compiler).
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter the operator when prompted (+, -, *, /, %, ^, s for sqrt, q to quit).
4. Enter the numbers as required.
5. Keep performing calculations until you enter `q` to quit.

### Example Usage:
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /, %, ^, s for sqrt, q to quit): +
Enter two numbers: 10 5
Result: 15

Enter an operator (+, -, *, /, %, ^, s for sqrt, q to quit): s
Enter a number: 25
Result: 5

Enter an operator (+, -, *, /, %, ^, s for sqrt, q to quit): q
